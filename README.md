# trainline.react
Craate UI mockup to show live updates for a train journey

## node
To build the API, run npm install & npm run server

## client
To run the demo, run npm install & npm start (npm test to run the test suite)


## the scenario
Build a Live Departure Board application that is used to show our customers the real-time status of trains from an industry data feed
The challenge is to use the supplied live departure board data (.json), to create a web component that faithfully reproduces a mock-up that UX\UI designers have put together.
